This project uses Playwright in VSCode to automate front end and functionality testing for websites.

Automation tests are run on https://www.doximity.com/dialer in this example demonstration.

The main tests are in 2 files

1) https://github.com/the-shadow/PlaywrightAutomation_Demonstration/blob/main/tests/logintest.spec.js
2) https://github.com/the-shadow/PlaywrightAutomation_Demonstration/blob/main/tests/testsuite.spec.js

Page Object Model is used, so basic webpage information is stored in page files in the page subdirectory
